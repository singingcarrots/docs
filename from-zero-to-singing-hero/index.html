Dominika guides you through practicing octaves (e.g., do - do) and the full major scale (e.g., do - re - mi - fa - sol - la - ti - do) to tie together your interval training and improve pitch accuracy across your vocal range.  </p>
<p><strong>Octaves:</strong> Practice large leaps between low and high pitches, using chest voice for low notes and head voice for high ones.<br />
<strong>Full Scale:</strong> Practice ascending and descending the major scale using solfège (do, re, mi, etc.), with breath control and smooth transitions between notes.  </p>
<p>These exercises help solidify your ability to stay on pitch, navigate registers, and build agility and ear training.</p>

<li><strong>Title:</strong> Building a Strong Foundation in Pitch and Intonation  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br />
Congratulations on completing Week 2 of the Singing Carrots: From Zero to Hero Singing Course! 🎉 This week, you took crucial steps toward mastering pitch and intonation by learning to hear, sing, and understand the fundamental intervals that make up melodies and harmonies.<br />
We started with half steps and whole steps, the smallest building blocks of Western music. By practicing these intervals, you began developing precision in pitch awareness, essential for accurate singing. The <em>Jaws</em> theme (“Da‑dum”) is a great example to reinforce the small, close movement of a half step.<br />
Next, we explored major thirds and perfect fifths, intervals that form the backbone of chords and melodies. You practiced singing arpeggios like “Do‑Mi‑Sol‑Mi‑Do,” combining intervals to build your vocal agility and strengthen your sense of musical patterns. Melodies like <em>Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star</em> helped illustrate the sound and feel of these intervals.<br />
Finally, we tied everything together with octaves and full scales, focusing on vocal range and intonation. Singing octaves like low “Do” to high “Do” helped you connect your registers, while full scales improved your pitch accuracy and prepared you for more complex melodies. Example songs like <em>Somewhere Over the Rainbow</em> and <em>Do‑Re‑Mi</em> reinforced these concepts in a fun and familiar way.<br />
Keep up the great work and see you in Week 3!</p>

<p><strong>Theme:</strong> This week is all about resonance—the way your voice vibrates and amplifies through your body to create stunning, unique tones.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="introduction-to-vocal-resonance">Introduction to Vocal Resonance</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Introductory Video  </li>
<li><strong>Reward:</strong> 20 carrot points  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br />
This video introduces the core concept of resonance, the process by which sound waves are amplified in your body — just like a guitar or violin. You’ll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is resonance:</strong> Vibration of sound in the chest, throat, and head areas.  </li>
<li><strong>Types of resonance:</strong>  </li>
<li><em>Chest Resonance</em> – Warm, deep tones.  </li>
<li><em>Head Resonance</em> – Bright, higher tones.  </li>
<li><em>Mixed Resonance</em> – A blend for smooth transitions.  </li>
<li><strong>The role of formants</strong> – Naturally amplified frequencies that shape your vocal timbre.  </li>
<li><strong>Why openness matters:</strong> Tension in the throat, jaw, or tongue can block your resonance.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of the week, you'll be able to shape your tone intentionally and adapt it for any genre.</p>

<p><strong>Exercises</strong>
1. <strong>Hello Exercise (mi - do)</strong><br />
   - Focus on chest vibrations while singing “Hello” on descending intervals<br />
   - Develops resonance awareness in your speaking range<br />
2. <strong>Vowel Drill (Mee Meh Mah Moh Moo)</strong><br />
   - Sing sustained vowels starting with “M” on a single pitch<br />
   - Emphasizes openness, relaxation, and chest register consistency  </p>

<li><strong>Reward:</strong> 30 carrot points  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br />
Dominika helps you unlock your head voice, the register where your sound resonates in your head or sinuses. Head resonance is key for singing higher notes with a light, floaty tone—and it's essential for developing mixed voice later on.</p>
<p>You'll explore this bright register through two light and airy exercises that avoid vocal strain and teach you to let sound travel upward naturally.</p>
<p><strong>Exercises</strong>
1. <strong>Owl Sound – Head Voice Activation</strong><br />
   - Mimic a soft “hoo” like an owl.<br />
   - Focus on where you feel the resonance (top of the head, near the ears).<br />
   - Keep the sound light and not pushed.<br />
2. <strong>Head Voice Glide (do - sol - do)</strong><br />
   - Use a breathy “he” to leap between two pitches.<br />
   - Keep the resonance floating and relaxed.<br />
   - Avoid pressing or pulling the sound into your chest.  </p>
<p><em>Tip:</em> Everyone senses head resonance differently—some near the forehead, others near the ears. All of it is valid! Stay relaxed and let your voice gently rise.</p>

   - Explore “twang” by mimicking a nasal, whiny voice to help locate your mix resonance.<br />
   - Focus on brightness and forward placement—no need to sound pretty.<br />
2. <strong>Mix Resonance Glide</strong><br />
   - Glide between pitches while maintaining the same twangy sound.<br />

<ul>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Video introduction  </li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br />
This week, you’ll learn to identify and navigate your vocal registers—chest, head, and mix—and begin to smooth out transitions between them. You’ll also explore the concept of a vocal break, that moment when your voice cracks as it shifts registers. Through targeted exercises, you'll build awareness and control to make these transitions seamless.</p>
<p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong>
- <strong>Chest Voice</strong> – Strong and grounded; feels low and full<br />
- <strong>Head Voice</strong> – Light and airy; resonates in the head and nasal cavity<br />
- <strong>Mix Voice</strong> – Blends chest and head voice for smooth transitions<br />
- <strong>Vocal Break</strong> – A natural shift in coordination between registers, which can be trained to sound smooth  </p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Build smoother transitions and increase control over your full range.</p>

Discover how your voice shifts between chest and head registers using vowel‑focused pitch exercises. You’ll feel and hear where each register lives and begin to link them together.</p>
<p><strong>Exercises</strong>
1. <strong>Chest to Head (do - sol - do)</strong><br />
   - Sing “ah - oo - ah” to feel resonance shift between registers<br />
   - Focus on sensing the difference in vibration location<br />
2. <strong>Smooth Connection (1 - 3 - 2 - 4 - 3 - 5 - 4 - 2 - 1)</strong><br />
   - Alternate between “ee” and “oo” vowels<br />
   - Maintain forward tone and smooth transitions  </p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong>
- Don’t force high notes—allow your head voice to take over<br />
- Keep jaw and tongue relaxed to avoid tension<br />
- A vocal break is normal; practice helps smooth it out  </p>

   - <em>Tip:</em> Keep the jaw dropped and tongue relaxed. Check your resonance by gently blocking the nose.<br />
2. <strong>“Mom” Hum and Open (do - re - mi - re - do)</strong><br />
   - Start with a hum, feel vibrations in the face (mask), and briefly open into a resonant “mom.” Helps you blend registers and find placement.<br />
