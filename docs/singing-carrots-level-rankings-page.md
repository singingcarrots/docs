# Singing Carrots Level Rankings Page: Full Technical Walkthrough

Page URL:  
<https://singingcarrots.com/pitch-training/level-rankings?level=#>

**Purpose:**  
This page displays the leaderboard for a selected level in Singing Carrots' Pitch Training tool. It highlights users who achieved the highest number of accurate pitch matches (note hits) in hard mode for a specific training level.  
Unlike the main leaderboard, which promotes consistent practice and rewards dedication regardless of skill level, this page focuses on technical precision.  
It is designed to recognize the most skillful users‚Äîthose who demonstrate excellent pitch accuracy on individual exercises.  

This structure supports Singing Carrots‚Äô broader gamification strategy:  
* The main weekly competition encourages regular use and inclusivity.  
* The level-based rankings provide space for performance-based achievement and skill recognition.  

Only hard mode scores are counted. Rankings are limited to the top 100 users per level and are updated automatically based on recorded performance data.
