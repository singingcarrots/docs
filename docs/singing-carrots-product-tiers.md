## Overview
The Product Tiers page provides a clear and structured comparison of Singing Carrots’ subscription plans.

The page adapts dynamically depending on whether a user is logged in and/or subscribed.

## Page Behavior Based on User Status

### If the user is **not logged in or not subscribed**
On an orange background at the top of the page:
- **Main prompt:** *Not sure which plan to choose?*  
- **Subtext:** *Compare the features of our plans below.*  
- **Button:** **See the prices** (green CTA)  
  - **Action:** Redirects to <https://singingcarrots.com/pro>  

This section orients new users and encourages plan selection by linking directly to the pricing page.

### If the user **is logged in**
The top section changes to reflect the user's subscription status:
- **Heading:** *My purchases*  
- **Displayed information:** *Current plan: [name of plan]*  
- **Subtext:** *Features by plan*  

This view reinforces what the user already has access to and helps them evaluate whether an upgrade or change would be beneficial.
