## Introduction
Looking to lift your singing to the next level?  
Singing Carrots offers you this universal educational singing course. Even though it is tailored to vocalists without experience, singers of all skill levels can benefit from it.

The course consists of 21 lessons. Each lesson contains a short video and a detailed read. Some lessons also introduce you to various warm-ups and cover practical vocal exercises with detailed instruction.

To benefit most from it, we advise pairing these lessons with our interactive Pitch Training Tool designed by certified voice teachers.

## How Do You Schedule the Lessons?
For absolute beginners, we advise going slowly through 1 lesson per week and combining it with practice sessions 3 to 5 times per week in our interactive Pitch Training Tool to work on intonation, rhythm and vocal range extension. The lessons will help you to learn the singing theory. Pitch Training will structure your practice routine and will help you to track your progress and boost your motivation.

If you already have some singing background, or are already a professional singer, our vocal coaches suggest you look through the list of our vocal lessons yourself and choose the topics that you find most interesting.

## FAQ Section

### Can I teach myself to sing?
Yes, Singing Carrots is specifically designed to facilitate self-study in singing. Our unique technology offers instant visual feedback, which is a game-changer in learning how to sing. This feature makes the learning process not just effective, but also immensely fun and engaging. The visual feedback helps you understand and correct your pitch, tone, and rhythm in real-time, ensuring that your self-study is as productive as possible.

Moreover, while a personal coach can provide valuable in-person guidance, Singing Carrots serves as an excellent starting point for those seeking affordable and flexible vocal training options. Our tools are designed to cater to learners of all levels, allowing you to progress at your own pace and in your own space.

### Can I learn to sing if I have no talent?
If there is one thing you should take away from this website, it is that you can sing.

There is plenty of research that proves that unless you have a medical condition (which is very rare to find) you can develop your singing to a pretty decent level.

Don't take my word for it. Read what people with a PhD say.  
Or check this study showing that 'amusia' is uncommon.  
I even wrote an article with a detailed break-down on why you might be struggling to hit the pitches at the moment.

The rule of 10,000 hours applies to singing as well. That's it.  
Invest time and you will become a better singer. It's that simple. And we are here to help :).

### Will singing lessons improve my voice?
Definitely! But only if you practice. At least 3 days a week for at least a month, and you will notice first results. There are no short-cuts - that's what any vocal instructor will tell you.

Singing Carrots offers structured self-study lessons that focus on essential vocal techniques and exercises. Our instant feedback and visual aids help you understand and improve your vocal performance. But it's only you who has to put in passion and time.

### How does Singing Carrots complement professional voice coaching?
Private singing lessons are the most effective way to improve your vocals. But it has its own drawbacks: private lessons are expensive, and it's hard to find a tutor that clicks with you. For an absolute beginner, it might be a good idea to take a free first lesson online and see how it goes before investing too much time and money.

While Singing Carrots is an excellent tool for self-study, it also serves as a great complement to professional voice coaching. Our technology can reinforce lessons learned with professionals, providing additional practice and feedback that enhances the overall learning experience.

### What makes Singing Carrots unique in teaching singing skills?
Singing Carrots stands out with its innovative use of technology, offering instant visual feedback and gamified learning experiences. This approach makes singing practice more engaging and effective, allowing learners to see real-time improvements in their skills.

### Are your singing lessons suitable for kids and absolute beginners?
Absolutely! Our lessons are perfectly suited for kids and absolute beginners. We ensure that the theory behind singing is conveyed in simple, easy-to-understand language without using complex terms.

Our focus is heavily on the practical aspects of singing. This includes interactive exercises and visual feedback, making the learning process not only straightforward but also enjoyable and engaging. By breaking down singing concepts into manageable parts, we ensure that even the youngest learners or those starting from scratch can follow along comfortably and develop their singing skills effectively.

### Do I need any previous singing experience or background to start lessons with Singing Carrots?
Absolutely not! Singing Carrots is designed to be accessible and beneficial for everyone, regardless of their prior experience or background in singing.

Our platform is ideal for beginners who are just starting their singing journey. We focus on providing clear, step-by-step guidance and exercises that build your skills from the ground up. With our intuitive visual feedback technology, you'll find it easy to start learning and see your progress in real-time.

### Is Singing Carrots a good tool to prepare for an audition?
Yes, Singing Carrots is an excellent tool for preparing for auditions. One of the unique features that makes it particularly useful for audition preparation is our comprehensive [vocal ranges database](https://singingcarrots.com/docs/find-songs-by-vocal-range-or-name). This allows you to search for songs that perfectly fit your vocal range, style, and gender.

Moreover, our platform provides instant visual feedback on your singing, which is invaluable for fine-tuning your performance. This feature helps you to work on specific areas like pitch accuracy, rhythm, and vocal control, all of which are crucial for a successful audition.
