## Overview

- Real-time pitch feedback with visual piano display
- Chat with your AI coach - ask questions and get guidance
- Earn carrot points as you reach milestones

- **Guided Edition:** Extended access
- **Legacy Plans:** Not included (Effective Learner, Pro Membership, Lifetime Access purchased before October 2025)


## Weekly Session Limits

We’re introducing weekly session limits for the AI Coach. Each plan includes a weekly allowance of sessions, and users can purchase extra credits if they need more.

### Weekly limits by plan

| Plan | Sessions per week |
|------|-------------------|
| Starter | 3 sessions/week |
| Self Study | 6 sessions/week |
| Guided | 6 sessions/week |
| Legacy plans (PRO, Effective Learner) | 3 sessions/week |



### How it works

- Unused sessions roll over to the next week (capped at **1-4** depending on plan).
- The week resets **every Monday at midnight** in the user’s timezone.
- When a user runs out of sessions, they see a prompt to either **buy credits** or **upgrade their plan**.
- Credit packs are **10 sessions** each and are purchased via **Stripe**.
- Credit purchases are **one-time payments**, not subscriptions.
- Credits **don’t expire**.

### What users will see

- Session balance shown on the AI Coach page (e.g. “3 sessions available”)
- Low sessions warning when sessions are running low
- When out of sessions: a modal directing the user to buy credits or upgrade
- A new quota page: **/virtual-coach/quota** showing balance breakdown, usage history, and purchase option

## Starting a Session

### Prepare Your Session

When you open AI Coach, you'll configure your session:

**Duration:** Choose how long you want to practice (5-60 minutes). The AI paces exercises to fit your time.

**Focus Area (Optional):** Tell the coach what you'd like to work on:
- "I want to work on high notes today"
- "My voice feels tired"
- "Focus on breath control"

**Recent Sessions:** Review summaries from your previous sessions.

Click **"Create My Session Plan"** to begin. The AI analyzes your progress and creates a personalized plan (this takes about 1-2 minutes).

## FAQ

**Q: How is AI Coach different from regular Pitch Training?**
A: Regular Pitch Training has fixed levels with preset exercises. AI Coach creates personalized sessions based on your history, adapts to your performance, and lets you chat with your coach.

**Q: What equipment do I need?**
A: Just a microphone (built-in works fine), headphones (recommended), and a quiet space. Works in any modern browser.

**Q: How long should sessions be?**
A: 15-20 minutes is ideal for most users. The AI paces exercises to fit your selected duration.

**Q: Can I ask the AI coach questions?**
A: Yes! Type any question in the chat. Ask about technique, request different exercises, or get feedback on challenges.

**Q: Does progress carry over between sessions?**
A: Yes. The AI remembers your history and previous sessions. Each new session builds on what you've practiced before.

**Q: What if I leave and come back?**
A: If you return within a few hours, you can continue your session. After that, you'll see a summary of your previous session and can start fresh.
