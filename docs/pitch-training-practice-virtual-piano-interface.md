## Purpose
**Practice Mode** is the heart of Singing Carrots. It turns your screen into an interactive piano lesson, combining a full‑range keyboard with real‑time pitch‑matching visuals so you can rehearse exactly the way a vocal teacher would guide you in class.  

- **Sing with the piano, instantly see accuracy.** Blue target lines show the melody; a red live line mirrors your voice so you know the moment you’re on (or off) pitch.  
- **Climb the scale like in a lesson.** Set any exercise—from simple arpeggios to octave jumps—and step through it up, down, or on loop to cover your whole range.  
- **Hear yourself, improve faster.** After each run you can replay and relisten to your own recording, pinpointing where you nailed it and where you drifted.  
- **Tailor every detail.** Choose the instrument sound, tempo, starting note, pauses, and even limit the exercise to just your comfortable notes.  

In short, Practice Mode replicates the core segment of a live vocal class—piano guidance plus instant feedback—so you can build pitch accuracy, range, and musical memory anytime, anywhere. Below you’ll find all the customization options in detail.

## Gamification and Statistics
Practice Mode is the fully customisable “free‑play” area. If you prefer to rehearse without chasing scores or leaderboards, you can do every exercise right here and ignore the competitive modes altogether. All other game modes are essentially built on top of this core tool—they take the same pitch‑matching engine, wrap preset melodies or time limits around it, and turn your singing into challenges that award scores.

- **Every note you sing**—correct or incorrect—is logged.  
- These note‑by‑note results are saved to your personal statistics and displayed on your dashboard.  
- **Carrot Points:** You earn 1 point per note. When you reach your daily target, you collect bonus points; the daily goal is calibrated to give enough practice time while preventing over‑exercising.


Use Practice Mode to warm up, fine‑tune melodies, or test your range, then head into the challenge modes whenever you want to convert that practice into scores and leaderboard positions.
