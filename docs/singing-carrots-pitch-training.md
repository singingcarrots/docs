### Section 3: Pitch Training: Levels Overview & Logic
The Pitch Training Game on Singing Carrots is structured around progressive levels, each designed to train different aspects of pitch accuracy, vocal memory, and control. Every level is centered around a specific melodic pattern and includes visual, interactive, and auditory tools to guide the user through multiple stages of increasing difficulty.

#### Level Structure
Each level includes:
- **Title** ‚Äì Describes the musical focus or technique being practiced (e.g., arpeggios, intervals, scales).
- **Tabs** ‚Äì Tags that summarize the focus and difficulty of the level.  
  *Hovering over each tab shows an explanatory tooltip.*

**Available Tabs and Their Meanings:**
- Pitch tuning ‚Äì This exercise is good for practising the notes in tune
- Arpeggio ‚Äì This exercise helps to learn arpeggio
- Minor ‚Äì This helps to practice Minor scale
- Major ‚Äì This helps to practice Major scale
- Pentatonic ‚Äì This helps to practice Pentatonic scale

#### Four Training Stages Per Level
Each level consists of four stages, arranged left to right:

**Practice**
- A fully customizable training environment with interactive piano and visual pitch feedback.
- Users can adjust BPM, select playback type, loop melodies, shift note direction, or limit training to their vocal range.
- Includes metronome, pitch reference sounds, and replay functionality.
- Access full documentation:  
  üëâ **Practice Mode: Virtual Piano Documentation**

**Basic**
- A guided version of the same melodic exercise.
- The user hears both the metronome and melody during the exercise.
- **Goal:** Match pitch and rhythm based on full audio support.

**Challenging**
- Same melodic pattern, but with reduced guidance.
- Only the metronome is played, no pitch reference.
- User must recall the melody from memory after hearing it once.
- Allows 3 mistakes before ending.

**Hard**
- The most advanced form of training.
- No sound is played during the test ‚Äî no melody, no metronome.
- The user must rely entirely on internal pitch memory and vocal control.
- Success is tracked and compared with global top scores.

All stages use a version of the interactive piano interface, showing:
- Target notes (as blue lines)
- User's pitch input (as red line)
- Color-coded feedback: green (in tune), yellow (slightly off)
- Real-time pitch stability visualization

**Note:** All four modes use the interactive pitch training piano, but only Practice mode includes full settings and playback control. The Basic, Challenging, and Hard modes use a simplified version of the interface with fewer options to ensure consistent testing conditions.

---

#### Mode Unlocking Logic
- When a user first opens a level: Only Practice and Basic modes are available.
- Challenging and Hard modes are greyed out and show this popup on hover or click:  
  **‚ÄúComplete BASIC to unlock‚Äù**
- Once the user successfully completes the Basic mode, both Challenging and Hard become available for that day.

**Level Progress Resets Daily**
- Completing any mode marks it as complete only for the current day. The next day, all levels reset to encourage daily vocal training.

---

#### Note Target Progress Counter
Each level displays a note hit tracker for the current day:  
**Format:** `0 / X`  
(e.g., `0 / 9`, `4 / 57` ‚Äî where X is the required number of correctly hit notes)  
The counter increases as the user successfully sings the required notes on pitch.  
This indicator helps track daily goal completion per level and provides motivation for practice consistency.

---

#### Performance Feedback & Top Scores
Each non-practice stage ends with a results popup, displaying:
- Notes hit
- Precision %
- Sustain %
- Carrot rewards
- Option to watch replay for extra carrots
- Encouraging messages from the carrot assistant

If the user performs particularly well (especially in Challenging or Hard mode), they‚Äôll see:
- **Leaderboard prompt** (‚ÄúStandings‚Äù)
- **Option to view top scores**
- **CTA to Try Hard Mode** (from Challenging)

This system ensures that users progressively build muscle memory, pitch accuracy, and ear training through structured daily repetition and increasing difficulty. It balances flexibility (Practice mode) with challenge and gamification (Basic ‚Üí Hard modes + note goals + leaderboard integration).
