## What is this website about?

SingingÂ Carrots brings together everything that might be useful for anyone practicing or simply interested in singing.

> **Key takeaway:** You can sing.

- Research shows that, unless you have a rare medical condition, youâ€¯canâ€¯develop your singing to a decent level.  
  - Seeâ€¯[this article from Pennâ€¯State](https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/probing-question-can-anyone-be-taught-how-sing/)  
  - Andâ€¯[this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28224991/) showing that *amusia* is uncommon.
- I wrote a detailed article on why you might struggle with pitch:  
  [Why People Sing Outâ€¯of Pitch](https://singingcarrots.com/blog/why-people-sing-out-of-pitch/)
- The **10,000â€‘hour rule** applies to singing too â€” invest time and you will improve.
