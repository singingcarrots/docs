We started with half steps and whole steps, the smallest building blocks of Western music. By practicing these intervals, you began developing precision in pitch awareness, essential for accurate singing. The Jaws theme (\u201cDa\u2011dum\u201d) is a great example to reinforce the small, close movement of a half step. Next, we explored major thirds and perfect fifths, intervals that form the backbone of chords and melodies. You practiced singing arpeggios like \u201cDo\u2011Mi\u2011Sol\u2011Mi\u2011Do,\u201d combining intervals to build your vocal agility and strengthen your sense of musical patterns. Melodies like Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star helped illustrate the sound and feel of these intervals. Finally, we tied everything together with octaves and full scales, focusing on vocal range and intonation. Singing octaves like low \u201cDo\u201d to high \u201cDo\u201d helped you connect your registers, while full scales improved your pitch accuracy and prepared you for more complex melodies. Example songs like Somewhere Over the Rainbow and Do\u2011Re\u2011Mi reinforced these concepts in a fun and familiar way. Keep up the great work and see you in Week\u202f3!</p> <p>Button - Mark Complete \u2013 Confirms task completion and awards points</p>"},{"location":"from-zero-to-singing-hero/#step-2-vocal-range-test","title":"Step\u202f2: Vocal Range Test","text":"<ul> <li>Type: Interactive Test  </li> <li>Reward: 40 carrot points  </li> </ul> <p>Purpose: Reassess your vocal range to track your progress and update your profile settings.

It is also useful for identifying the user's actual, functional vocal range, as the histogram shows which notes the user can consistently sustain in tune. Additionally, it may help detect a vocal break \u2014 a noticeable drop in accuracy around the notes where the user transitions between vocal registers (e.g., chest to head voice).</p>"},{"location":"singing-carrots-stats-page/#33-pitch-accuracy-over-time","title":"3.3.
